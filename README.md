# DevDev

We like to learn, especially from each other.

DevDev is an LGSS Digital community for developers to learn from each other, develop new skills and build things together so that when we work with others, our skills are already razor sharp.

## Purpose

This repo is set up to help with DevDev work, a home for tools and ideas to help get going quickly with minimal fuss.


## Stuff to cover

A [list of TODOs](TODO.md) is maintained for now, this is a list of things that people have asked about and want to go through.

If you have something you want to add to the list, an idea you have or an answer to something we've not covered yet, follow the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
